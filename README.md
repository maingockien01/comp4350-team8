## Project Summary and Vision: **ScheduleMaster**

### **Summary**

Our project aims to transform the way students handle their academic schedules and plan their degree path effectively. This comprehensive web application provides an easy-to-use platform featuring three main components: "View Courses," "My Calendar," and "Roadmap." The "View Courses" page allows students to explore and seamlessly add available courses for the term to their personalized schedules. Once courses are added, students can access the "My Calendar" page, where their timetable is visually presented with distinctive colors or icons for quick identification. Additionally, the "Roadmap" page empowers students to strategically plan their entire degree, promoting a well-thought-out academic journey. By serving as a centralized hub for course management, timetable visualization, and degree planning, "ScheduleMaster" aims to enhance the student experience, fostering improved organization and time management throughout their academic pursuits.

### Vision

The vision of "ScheduleMaster" is to empower students through a holistic and user-centric approach to managing their academic schedules. We envision a platform where students can effortlessly explore and add courses, intuitively visualize their schedules, and strategically plan their degree trajectory. "ScheduleMaster" aims to be the preferred tool for students, promoting efficiency, organization, and a proactive approach to academic planning. Through user-friendly interfaces and innovative visualizations, our project seeks to simplify students' lives, ensuring they make the most of their educational experience.
